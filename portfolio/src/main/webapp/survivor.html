      <h3><u>#3- Survivor: Cagayan- Brains vs Brawn vs Beauty (Season 28)</u></h3>

      <p>
          Survivor Cagayan is a great season, mainly because there were so many legendary players.
          This season saw the first appearances of tony, Spencer, Tasha, Kass, and Sarah, who all did
          extremely well when they played subsequent times. Even people who left early, like J'Tia
          and Brice, were still fun and memorable in their own way. The chaotic strategic gameplay 
          used in this season, as well as its rootable underdogs, make this season one for the 
          books.

      <h3><u>#3- Survivor: Kaoh Rong- Brains vs Brawn vs Beauty (Season 32)</u></h3>

      <p>
          After the success of Cagayan, the producers decided to try out the Brains vs Brawn vs Beauty
          format again. WHile the gameplay wasnt as dynamic, the cast was amazing. Unfortunately, this
          ended up being the most dangerous season, with three medical evacuations (still currently the 
          record for any one season). That being said, it has one of the most exciting final fours of
          all time, and its filled to the brim with people you love, and people you love to hate.

      <h3><u>#3- Survivor: Winners at War (Season 40)</u></h3>

      <p>
          This season had hands down, the best cast of all time. As the title of the season implies, this
          cast is made up of people who won the game before. Watching the best of the best duke it out 
          was amazing, and helped me get through the first few weeks of quarantine. It had an exciting 
          pre-merge and early merge period, but overall it came a bit less exciting, as one player pretty
          much dominated the endgame, with a few other just not really doing much exciting. That being 
          said, the caliber of the cast definitely made up for it, and it was nice to see certain people
          play again after all these years.
      </p>
      <h3><u>#2- Survivor: Cambodia- Second Chance (Season 31)</u></h3>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1ETnIXwgOQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
          This was the most strategically intense season of all time. What made this season different 
          from the others before it is that the cast was voted in by the fans. I believe this is the
          factor that cranked everything to 11. Everyone was playing their hearts out, and used their 
          strengths to their best capabilities. That, combined with an unusually large merge period, 
          made for some bold gameplay, and an ultimately satisfying final three that made it to the end
          of the game.

      <h3><u>#1- Survivor: David vs Goliath (Season 37)</u></h3>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEYW4xs4EJU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
          While Winners at War had the best cast of all time, this season had the best cast of all new 
          players ever. Everyone felt like a dynamic and interesting person, and the show's edit showcased
          it very well. This was everyone's first attempt at playing, but they played with the competency 
          of veterans. The flashy moves of the early merge combined with the ever shitfting power dynamics
          for the rest of the season make this a very enjoyable watch.
