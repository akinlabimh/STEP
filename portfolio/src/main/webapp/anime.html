      <h3><u>Jojo's Bizzare Adventure</u></h3>

          Jojo's Bizzzare Adventure is split up into "parts," where each part revolves around 
          the adventures of a decendant of the Joestar bloodline. Each part is incredibly 
          different. For instance, Part One focuses on slaying vampires, while Part Five
          revolves around taking down a mafia. It starts out slow, but its a pretty fun anime
          I would rate 9/10.

      <h3><u>My Hero Acedamia</u></h3>

          If you want a light-hearted action anime, this is a great one to start. MHA takes place
          in the distant future, where most humans have evolved into having special abilities, 
          or "quirks". Our main chracter, Izuku Midorya, attends an elite high school in order
          to train himslef to be the best superhero he can be. Overall I would consider it a 9/10
          anime.

      <h3><u>Demon Slayer</u></h3>

          Taking place in Japan right before the industrial revolution, A boy named Tanjiro Kamado's
          life takes a dark turn when his entire family is killed by a demon. The only survivor is his
          sister Nezuko, who was turned into a demon herself. After this, Tanjiro joins the elite Demon
          SLayer Corps, in order to find a way to cure his sister. Oevrall, even though it starts out 
          generic the later episodes are great, and the anime as a whole contains the greatest 
          animation I have ever seen. Considering all that, I'd give it a 8.5/10.
