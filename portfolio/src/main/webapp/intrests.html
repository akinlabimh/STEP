      <h2>INTRESTS</h2>
      <p>There are two things that interest me the most.</p>
      <p>
        The first of these things is Anime. I've been watching anime and reading manga
        since I was in 8th grade. I was hooked after my first series: Fullmetal
        Alchemist: Brotherhood. Currently some of my favorites are My Hero Acadamia,
        Demon SLayer, and Jojo's Bizzare Adventure. If you wanna hear more about my opinions,

      </p>
      <p>
          My other major interest is the TV show "Survivor" on CBS. The game is always
          unpredictible and fun, and usually the contestant I'm rooting for ends up winning.
          I've seen almost every season, and recomend the series to anyone who is considering
          checking it out. You can find out more on my thoughts of each season<a href=
